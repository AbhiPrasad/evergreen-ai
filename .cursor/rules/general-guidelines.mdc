# General Development Guidelines

## Import Guidelines

- **AVOID** dynamic imports (`await import()`) in favor of direct imports
- Dynamic imports should only be used when absolutely necessary (e.g., conditional loading, code splitting)
- Prefer static imports at the top of files for better tree-shaking and bundle analysis
- **ALWAYS** prefix Node.js standard library imports with `node:`

## Cursor Configuration

- Use `.cursor/rules/` directory for project-specific rules (not `.cursorrules`)
- Follow the official Cursor documentation: https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/rules
- Each rule file should have proper frontmatter with description and globs

## Code Quality

- Maintain consistent coding style across the project
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
